# devoirStudi2
after a few script tests on one, it's all mixed up, I created a general scripts folder and made the links on all the html.
I more or less understood last for this post the readme.
I changed 2 images, modified the day night code, made the last corrections. 2/3/22
now I am doing the paper rendering of the JS2 assignments to unlock assignment 2.
